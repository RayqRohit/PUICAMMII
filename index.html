                    The <strong>2nd International Conference on Advances in Medical Microbiology (PUICAMM–II)</strong>
                    is highly relevant in the current global scenario marked by emerging and re-emerging infectious
                    diseases, increasing antimicrobial resistance, and the growing demand for rapid and accurate
                    diagnostics.
                    Medical microbiology represents a critical thrust area for pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
                    diagnostics, vaccine manufacturing, and public health sectors. The conference aims to create a vital
                    interface between academia, clinicians, industry experts, and policymakers, facilitating the
                    translation of laboratory research into clinically and commercially viable solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The programme also supports capacity building by exposing students and early-career researchers to
                    industry trends, regulatory standards, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and translational research
